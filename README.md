This my personal snippet manager. It lets you find, insert, delete and list out
all snippets stored in a text file and written with straightforward, I believe,
syntax rules. My goal was to keep the program as simple as possible: it scans
the source file with snippets and offers an interface to interact with it.

There are two parts of the workflow: one, `gsnipd`, a server running on Unix
Domain Socket handling connections, and `gsnip`, which is the client that
relies on `FD0` or `SDTIN` and simple sub-commands to send messages to the
server.

`gsnipd`, `gsnip` and all its subcommands print out useful information with
`-h|--help`.

First, you want to spin up the server with either of these commands:

```sh
gsnipd
gsnipd &>/dev/null &
```

You can enable it as a daemon in systemd or launchd on MacOS so that it
runs on startup.

The source file used to store snippets can be passed as an argument to the
`gsnipd` program. If it isn't, the program will create an empty file at the
first available `gsnip` subdirectory at XDG data directories in this order:

```sh
$HOME/.local/share/gsnip/
/usr/local/share/gsnip/
/usr/share/gsnip/
```

It will error out if it could not find one.

The first one will write `STDERR` to the terminal so that you can see server
messages. The other one sends all messages to `/dev/null` and gets detached
from the current session.

Then you can interact with the server using `gsnip` client like this:

```sh
echo [snip-name] | gsnip find
gsnip list
echo [snip-name] | gsnip delete
gsnip insert
gsnip reload
```

You can query the server with `find` for any snippet stored in the source file.
Alternatively, you can ask the server to `list` out all available snippets.
You can delete existing snippets with `delete` subcommand. You can also `insert`
new snippets through an editor or `STDIN`.

In order to add a new snippet right from the command line, the easy way would be
to use HereDoc like this, for instance:

```sh
gsnip insert << EOF
startsnip test "this is just a test snippet"
func test() bool {
	return true
}
endsnip
EOF
```

You can reload the source snippet file at the server runtime by calling the
`gsnip` client with the `reaload` subcommand, which is the equivalent of
sending `SIGHUP` to the process using `kill -1 [pid]`. The latter is annoying
because you have to find the process id with `ps` before sending the signal.
Another way would be to write PID to a known file that the client could access.

For the sake of clarity, there are five headers that a `gsnipd` server can
understand:

- @LST
- @RLD
- @FND
- @INS
- @DEL

They correspond to the client subcommands.


The idea was to use `gsnip` as an application agnostic tool. Since it operates
on standard file descriptors, it can be used in most Unix pipes and most
importantly `vim` through the use of `!` inside the editor. I do not like other
editors.


## Syntax

The snippet syntax looks like this:

```
startsnip NAME "COMMENT"
BODY
endsnip
```

`startsnip` and `endsnip` delimit the scope of a single snippet. They are used
by the parser to identify the start and the end. There few more rules that have
to be respected:

1. `NAME` could be anything so long as it does not contain any white space
   characters.
2. `NAME` must not be a reserved `gsnip` command (e.g., `@LST` would list out
   all the snippets found in the file).
3. `COMMENT` should always be enclosed in double quotes.
4. Finally, `BODY` can be pretty much anything.


The `snippet` package has a snippet container based on `PostgreSQL` database.
You might want to use it instead of the file-based implementation, but you'd
need to do a little rewrite of the server `gsnipd` command to accommodate for
this change. I personally do not like this because it makes the program clunky.
Database would then contain a simple table with the name, comment and body text
fields. There isn't really more to it---it does the same work as a flat file.


## Installation

Consult `Makefile`; there is an `install` directive that you can call with
`make install`, and that's pretty much it when it comes to the installation of
this Go program. Make sure that the directory where it's installed is on your
$PATH.


## Testing

I am using the `testing` package from the Go standard library, so you can call
`test ./... -v`, or you can resort to `Makefile` and use `make test` command. I
am really not worried about the coverage at this stage; the program is way to
simple and test as they currently are, they cover all of the functional
bottlenecks of the program. However, if you want to peek at the coverage, type
`make cover` and the `make clean` once you're done.

Don't forget to install `golint` before you run the test command from the 
Makefile:

```sh
go get -u golang.org/x/lint/golint
```
